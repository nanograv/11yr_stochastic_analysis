											We search for a <b>gravitational-wave
											background</b> (GWB) in the newly released 11-year dataset
											from the <a href="http://nanograv.org/">North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational
											Waves (NANOGrav)</a>. While we find <b>no significant evidence for a GWB</b>,
											we place <b>new constraints</b> on a GWB from a population of inspiraling
											supermassive black-hole binaries, from a network of cosmic strings, and from a primordial GWB.
											For the first time, we find that the <b>GWB upper limits and
											detection statistics are sensitive to the Solar-System ephemeris</b>
											(SSE) model that we assume, and that SSE errors can mimic a GWB signal.
											We develop and implement a novel approach to model SSE errors, producing the first pulsar-timing GWB <b>constraints that are robust against SSE uncertainties</b>. In keeping with the principles of open science,
											<b>we release the source code and data for our analysis</b>, as well as a Docker image that can be used to reproduce it.

														Precision timing of millisecond pulsars over years
															and decades allows us to build <b>models of radio-pulse
															arrival times of incredible accuracy</b>. These models
															account for the pulsar's spin period, its evolution, the dispersion of radio pulses in
															the interstellar medium, and many other effects.
													</li>

													<li>
														A <b>gravitational wave</b> (GW) propagating between the Earth
															and a pulsar will <b>stretch and squeeze</b>
															space-time between them. This causes alternating
															advances and delays of pulse arrival times with
															respect to our model's predictions.
													</li>

													<li>
														A <b>random background of GWs</b> will lead to apparent noise
															in the pulsar arrival times, with power predominantly
															at low frequencies. Such a background could come from many <b>inspiraling supermassive black-hole binaries</b> (SMBHBs),
															a network of <b>cosmic strings</b>, or space-time fluctuations of <b>primordial origin</b>.
													</li>

													<li>
														While random, this background affects all pulsars in the
															 Milky Way with <b>predictable correlations</b>. We leverage
															 this signature, correlating the pulse times of arrival from our large arrays of pulsars, to search for
															 the common influence of GWs, interpreting results

													<li>
														We find that <b>upper limits</b> (shown here at 95% credibility) and signal-vs.-noise

													<li>
														The most influential errors arise from the <b>uncertainties on Jupiter's
